# Project Summary

The electric vehicle (EV) industry has witnessed unprecedented growth, reshaping the automotive technology landscape. This project presents a comprehensive data visualization project that addresses the informational needs of key stakeholders in the EV sector in the Washington State: investors, potential EV purchasers, and policymakers. Our project offers a detailed analysis of the EV market, including market share, brand performance, and geographical distribution of EVs. Through a user-friendly dashboard, stakeholders can access vital data. The project also provides insights into the growth of EV adoption, the comparative analysis of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and the distribution of electric range, enabling informed decision-making for investors, purchasers, and policymakers.

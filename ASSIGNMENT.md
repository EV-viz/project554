## Rubric

### Demonstration

Students should produce a working demonstration of a dashboard or interactive infographic and document design decision, data preprocessing and analysis used.

| Level         | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Sophisticated (4-5 pts) | The project demonstration is working well and is well documented with development set-up instructions, deployment details, design documents, and notebooks. The website functions smoothly, showcasing a well-designed interface. Visualizations are thoughtfully created, properly formatted, and seamlessly integrated into the project. The inclusion of at least one map enhances the overall presentation. |
| Competent (2-3 pts) | The project demonstration functions adequately, but there are some areas that require improvement. The documentation provides basic set-up instructions and deployment details. The website is functional, though there might be minor design inconsistencies. Visualizations are present, but they may lack some refinement in design and formatting. |
| Needs work (0-1 pts) | The project demonstration is incomplete or not functioning properly. Documentation is minimal or missing, making it difficult to understand the development set-up or deployment process. The website and visualizations are rudimentary or non-functional, lacking design and functionality. Important components, such as maps, are missing. |

### Paper

Students should write a final paper about the project as if they were submitting it to a conference for publication. The papers should be written in the [LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and should be at most 5 pages long. The paper should be organized as a publication, stating the problem being addressed, the approach and description of the system, evaluation, related work and references.

| Level         | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Sophisticated (4-5 pts) | The paper is written following the LNCS format template provided and is 5 pages or less including the references. The paper is clearly written using concise language, is well organized, includes well formatted figures and tables, and presents all important project information well. Additionally, it incorporates pertinent references to related work. |
| Competent  (2-3 pts) | The paper is written following the LNCS format template but may slightly exceed 5 pages, including references. The language is generally clear and organized, though there might be occasional instances of ambiguity or lack of clarity. Figures and tables are included, although they could benefit from improved formatting or relevance. The paper covers most of the important project information adequately, but some areas might lack depth or detail. Related work references are included, but there might be a few missing or less pertinent citations. Overall, the paper demonstrates a competent level of understanding and effort. |
| Needs work  (0-1 pts) | The paper does not adhere to the LNCS format guidelines, exceeding 5 pages or lacking proper formatting. The language used is unclear, disorganized, or overly verbose, hindering the reader's comprehension. Figures and tables, if included, are poorly formatted or irrelevant to the content. The paper lacks coherence and fails to cover essential project details adequately. There is a lack of depth in the explanation of the methodology, results, or conclusions. Related work references are either missing or inadequately cited, indicating a limited understanding of the existing literature. Overall, the paper does not meet the necessary standards and requires significant improvements. |

### Video

Students should produce a 5-minute or less video of their application and upload it to YouTube. The video should present and demonstrate the most important aspects of the project.

| Level         | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Sophisticated (4-5 pts) | The video is uploaded on YouTube and is within the specified duration of 5 minutes or less. It is well produced, introduces the project well and provides a demonstration of the most important aspects of the project. |
| Competent  (2-3 pts) | The video is uploaded on YouTube and meets the 5-minute or less requirement, but there might be some room for improvement in production quality. The introduction to the project is adequate, and important aspects are demonstrated, although there could be more clarity or detail in certain parts. |
| Needs work  (0-1 pts) | The video does not meet the 5-minute or less requirement or is not uploaded to YouTube. It lacks proper organization and fails to effectively introduce or demonstrate the project's important aspects. |

### Presentation

Students will present to the class their projects. The presentations should be 5 minutes in length with up to 5 minutes questions and answers.

| Level         | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Sophisticated (4-5 pts) | The presentation is well produced and delivered, meets the 5-minute requirement, introduces the project well and provides a demonstration of the most important aspects of the project. |
| Competent  (2-3 pts) | The presentation is meets the 5-minute requirement, but there might be some room for improvement in the slides quality or presentation. The introduction to the project is adequate, and important aspects are demonstrated, although there could be more clarity or detail in certain parts. |
| Needs work  (0-1 pts) | The presentation does not meet the 5-minute requirement. It is not well delivered, lacks proper organization and fails to effectively introduce or demonstrate the project's important aspects. |
